    <h1><center><em>The Show</em></center></h1>
<center><p>A hundred years following the life events of Empress Elisabeth "Sisi" of Austria, her assasain, Luigi Lucheni is still being questioned for his actions by a bodyless judge. He states he did it because she wanted it, that she was--and still is--the lover of Death himself. Then in flashbacks, Sisi's life is shown, from the first time she meets Death after a circus accident, to her wedding where she marries Emperor Franz Joseph I, and the death of her first born daughter. It also follows the second half of her life as she traveled the world, the suicide murder of her only son and his misteress, and ultimately her assassination in Geneva, Switzerland. </p></center>
<center><p>All through out this, Death follows her and asks her to join him as he is enamoured by her and she by him. But rather succumbing to him, she pushes him away until he decides that desperate times call for drastic measures.</p></center>
