      <em><center><h2>The Show</h2></center></em>
      <center><p>The show opens with a young woman, Mrs. De Winter remembering her and her husband's home, Manderley. The story goes back in time to when Mrs. De Winter, or "Ich," meets her husband Maxim de Winter in Monte Carlo. Following their wedding, the couple goes back to Cornwall, England; to Manderley. Awaiting their arrival is the staff and the housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers. Once Ich arrives at the house she is dogged by the memory of Rebecca de Winter, Maxim's first wife who died in a boating accident a year ago, thanks to Mrs. Danvers who shared a close relationship with the woman.Unfortunately, the de Winters' lives become even more complicated when Rebecca's body and boat is found near another shipwreck--a year after her body was identified. </p></center>
