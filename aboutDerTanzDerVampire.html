      <h3><center><em>The Show</em></center></h3>
      <center><p>During the late 1800s a professor and his assistant, Alfred stumble upon a small village in the Carpathian Mountains with one goal in mind; to prove the existance of vampires. They are taken in by a skirt-chasing innkeeper, Chagal, after being ostracized by the towns people, who has a daughter, Sarah, around Alfred's age. Sarah, manipulates Alfred into letting her steal his room for a bath, there she meets Count von Krolock--a vampire--who invites her to a ball; he is then discovered and Sarah is punished. Chagal is then turned into a vampire and drains the blood of a chambermaid--alerting the professor and Alfred of Chagal's change. In the meantime Sarah is at the castle of the Count exploring and preparing for the upcoming ball, while Alfred and the professor are being shown around the castle. Alfred is then tasked with killing the Count and his son, Herbert, but Alfred just wishes to leave the castle with Sarah. At the ball though, things don't go according plan for the professor and Alfred, who plan to sneak Sarah out of the ball, when she is bitten and their cover is blown by a mirror. It is then a race for them, to get away from the dangerous mob of vampires.</p></center>
